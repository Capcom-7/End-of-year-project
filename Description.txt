The database will be a list of Restaurant objects. Each restaurant object will have several qualities.
[Name, Star rating,, Takeout/sit-in, Type of food, Hours, Location]
If someone wants to search for 5-star places, for example, it will search everything in the database, checking if it has 5 stars.
Once it does, it creates a list of 5 stars it will show to the user.

However, this list needs to be organized by convenience. If the user searches by anything other than location, it will sort by location. Closest ones on top.
If they search for the nearest ones, however, it will sort by stars.
